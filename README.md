A data science project to predict rossman daily sales for up to six weeks in advance.

## Dataset Information:

This dataset was originally used in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) and it was provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. However, here it was used to create a data science project.

## Context

The stakeholder need investment in store renovation, but they don't know how much it will cost. Therefore they ask the data scientist to create a project to help them to idealize a solution for this problem, in other words, predict the sales for up to six weeks in advance. If they know the store's sales they can use part of the revenue to reinvest in renovation of the stores.

### Objective
Create a data science project to predict daily sales for up to six weeks in advance.
